/* Transition Styles */
/*This brings in an image of an ellipse image with a double yellow border
and is defaulted at not showing over the nav link. It has a pre-set text color (reddish)
that it will transition into from the default color (yellowish) in 0.8 seconds when hovered over 
and opens the image to 100% size in 0.3 seconds at the same instant. JF*/

    background: url(ba_target.png) center center / 0% 0% no-repeat;
    color: rgb(253,240,133);
    transition: background 0.3s, color 0.8s;

/* Animation Styles */
/*The keyframes mark instances at percantages of transition time between 0%
and 100% transformation. Here the starting positions(0px), drop shadows behind the ball,
and text color are set at 0% transition. At 49% the x axis scale increases by 1.
At 50% the ball positions are at the center where they meet, the shadows are directly
behind the balls and the x-axis shrinks giving the illusion they squish together. After
this the transition mirrors in reverse for the red ball at 51% and finally at 100% effectively resetting
the red ball to the start and showing the collision momentum change of the blue ball to the right. JF*/

/*Show text and hide text use the same percentage intervals as above; though
these control the opacity at the intervals and are compliments of each other
with 0 being transparent. JF*/

/*These initiate the animations. redBall and blueBall use moveRed and moveBlue
for their animation parameters and will happen over the course of 5 seconds, moving in
linear form toward each other and will happen infinitely. The same is said of redSpeed1
and blueSpeed1 using hideText and showText. JF*/
